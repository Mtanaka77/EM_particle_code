EM_particle code

An electromagnetic particle code is utilized for solar and magnetospheric 
space physics. Both electric and magnetic fields at low frequencies 
are solved by a slightly backward time decentering technique. 
Magnetic reconnection and solar wind-earth magnetic field coupling 
are quite suitable for applying this simulation code.

One uses here the time decentered scheme in aimpl=0.6, while the 
time centered scheme in the explicit code (aimpl=0.5) is used in the 
other directory of molecular dynamics simulations. 
It is noted, however, that finite errors in the divergence term accumulate 
which must be corrected if the finite difference coordinate space are utilized. 
Four physical units are, i) time: 1/wpe (c/wpe: electron inertia length), 
ii) length: c/wpe, iii) mass: electron mass, and iv) charge: electron charge. 
The program is written in Fortran 2003 and MPI version 3 for parallelization.

By the implicit scheme it is free from the Courant condition, that is, 
Dx(length)/Dt(time step) >< c, the speed of light. 
For the backward differential scheme in aimpl > 0.5, a time step may be 
dt~1.2/wpe to dump out plasma oscillations, while 2 \pi/dt wce > 1 
for the kinetic ions and electrons. 
A large time step of 2 \pi/dt wce >> 1 is a good target of the drift-kinetic 
simulation, where a typical time step may be dt= 10/wpe. 
Reading references of this implicit particle code is recommended.

One can enjoy simulations by changing system sizes and boundary conditions. 
For the present case, an equilibration of the pair of flux bundles is tested in 
three dimensions. Kinetic ions and electrons are simulated which is 
an igc=1 case specified in the rec_3d15A file. Then, one can start a merging of
flux bundles. 
On the other case, the drift-kenetic electrons and kinetic ions are simulated
as a large time step can be used as the igc=2 case. 
But, one should note that heavy ions move kinetically while light electrons 
lose some of their flexibility.
