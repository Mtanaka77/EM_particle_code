EM_particle code

An electromagnetic particle code is utilized for solar and 
magnetospheric space physics. Both electric and magnetic fields 
at low frequencies are solved by a slightly backward time 
decentering technique. 
Magnetic reconnection and solar wind-earth magnetic field coupling 
are quite suitable for applying this code.

One uses here the time decentered scheme \aimpl=0.6, while the time centered 
scheme in the explicit code (\aimpl=0.5) is used in the other directory of 
molecular dynamics simulations. 
It is noted that finite errors in the divergence term accumulate 
which must be corrected if the finite difference coordinates 
are utilized. 
Four physical units are, i) time: 1/wpe (c/wpe: 
electron inertia length), ii) length: c/wpe, iii) mass: electron mass, 
and iv) charge: electron charge. 
The program is written in Fortran 2003, and MPICH 3 for parallelization.

By the implicit scheme it is free from the Courant condition, that is, 
Dx(length)/Dt(time step) >< c, the speed of light. 
For the backward differential scheme \aimpl > 0.5, a time step may be 
dt~1.2/wpe to dump out plasma oscillations, while 2 \pi/dt \wce > 1 for 
the kinetic ions and electrons. 
A large time step of 2 \pi/dt \wce >> 1 is a good target of the 
drift-kinetic simulation code, where a typical time step may be 
dt= 10/\wpe. References to read this implicit particle code are recommended.
