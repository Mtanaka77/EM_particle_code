EM_particle code

An electromagnetic particle code is utilized for solar and magnetospheric 
space physics. Both electric and magnetic fields at low frequencies 
are solved by the backward decentering technique. 
Magnetic reconnection and solar wind-earth magnetic field coupling 
are quite suitable.

One uses here the time decentered scheme \aimpl=0.6, while the
time centered scheme in the explicit code is \aimpl=0.5 in the 
directory of molecular dynamics. 
It is noted that finite errors in divergence term accumulate 
if any method of the finite difference scheme is utilized.
Four physical units are, i) time: 1/wpe (c/wpe: electron 
inertia length), ii) length: c/wpe, iii) mass: electron mass, 
iv) charge: electron charge.

By the implicit scheme it is free from the Courant condition, 
that is Dx(length)/Dt(time step) >< c, the speed of light. 
But, one must note that for the backward differential scheme 
\aimpl > 0.5, a time step may be dt=1.5/wpe to dump out plasma 
oscillations while 2 \pi/dt \wce > 1 for the kinetic ions and electrons. 
A large time step of 2 \pi/dt \wce >> 1 is a good target of 
the drift-kinetic simulation code, where a typical time step may be
dt= 10/\wpe.
